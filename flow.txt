# a matrix is stored as a list of lists
# example
# matrix = []
# row1 = []
# row1.append(1, 2, 3)
# row2 = []
# row2.append(4, 5, 6)
# matrix.append(row1)
# matrix.append(row2)
# matrix now looks like the following
# [1  2  3]
# [4  5  6]

proposed flow for the program

1) Input (GUI Opens to a basic page with a start button):
    (press start)
    (new GUI page pops up with 2 questions:
        - Ask the user if their matrix is a coefficient matrix or an augmented matrix
            - we can use this information to print the solution to the system of equations at the end
            if it is an augmented matrix
        - Ask the user for the dimensions of the matrix they are going to input (max 6 x 6):
    (press continue) (gives errors if any values are non-integers, blank, or exceed the limit of)
        - An empty matrix with n x m boxes pops up so they can enter the values of their matrix
    (press submit) (gives errors if any of the values are not integers or if any values are blank)
    
    
2) Parsing their input
    - isAugmented will be set based on their response
    - The dimensions that they input in the first page will determine what matrix image comes up
    - The values they entered into their matrix will be placed in a list of lists so that each
    member can be accessed: matrix[row][column]

3) Process of row reducing begins using gaussian elimination:
    - begin by ordering the matrix from least to most leading zeros from top to bottom
    - go column by column
        - before converting anything to 0 go down the current column and move the first row you
        find with a leading entry of 1 to the (top + current column)
        - if no 1 is found then just leave the rows as they are and divide the current row by the
        leading entry of that row
        - if the number underneath the current row leading entry is NOT 0:
            - multiply every entry of current row by the negative of the leading entry of 
            (current row + 1) but don't overwrite the currentRow
            - add each member of the current row to the (currentrow + 1)
        - Show the current state of the matrix to the user because we just performed an operation

    - if augmented: begin at n - 1
    - if coefficient: begin at n
    go backwards from column to column:
        for each row above the pivot point going upwards:
            - multiply the current row by the negative value of current row - 1 *not correct
